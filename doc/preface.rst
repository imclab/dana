Who should read this book ?                                                    
===============================================================================

You  should read this  book if  you intent  to develop  models using  the DANA
computing framework and  especially if your models belong  to the computational
neuroscience domain. DANA  is a python library and  depends heavily on external
library  such as  numpy  and scipy.  However,  this book  does  not provide  a
tutorial  to the  python language  neither an  introduction to  the numpy/scipy
libraries. If  you're  unfamiliar  with both  of them,  you're  encouraged  to
document yourself first  by considering  external resources for  both python,
numpy and scipy.

If you're unfamiliar  with python, have a look first at  the very nice tutorial
by Mark  Pilgrim (which is also available  as a book). Numpy  user guide should
gives  you the  main concepts  related  to vectorized  computation while  scipy
tutorial may be considered optional but worth reading anyway.

A lot of examples are given throughout the book and the may be related to
either a regular shell, a python shell or an ipython shell. You can easily
distinguish them by the prompt they use:

**System shell**::

    $ 

**Python/IPython shell**::

    >>> 

Furthermore, since numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries are extensively used
throughout the whole book, they will respectively referred as ``np``, ``sp``,
and ``plt`` and are supposed to have been imported as::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import scipy as sp
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
